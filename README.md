# Active-Lattice-Gas
This repository contains some Monte Carlo and Pseudospectral codes for a active lattice gas model. 
Reference - Hydrodynamics of a hard-core non-polar active lattice gas (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19984)

This video shows the comparison between Monte Carlo and hydrodynamic simulations. Solid lines represent 
hydrodynmaics and markers represent Monte Carlo simulation.

Another video showing the comparison between Monte Carlo and hydrodynamic simulations but in a different parameter regime which shows MIPS.
