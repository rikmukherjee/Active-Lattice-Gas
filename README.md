# Active-Lattice-Gas
This repository contains some Monte Carlo and Pseudospectral codes for a active lattice gas model. 
Reference - Hydrodynamics of a hard-core non-polar active lattice gas (https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19984)

This video shows the comparison between Monte Carlo and hydrodynamic simulations for two different set of 
parameters. Solid lines represent hydrodynmaics and markers represent Monte Carlo simulation. Depending on 
the parametrs the system either goes to a phase separated state or goes to a homogeneous state.

This video shows Monte Carlo evolution for a 2d system with 2 apecies and 4 species.
